3x3 arrays of plots are for 3 line lengths and three loading scenarios.
Line lenghts and loading change according to the following.

line_lengths = [100, 250, 500]
loading_scenarios = [(0.5, 0.5), (0.75, 0.25), (1.0, 0.0)]

Line lenghts increase going vertically down, loading scenarios change going horizontally right.
